# Ordered-Vector

## Here we have the classic Ordered Vector algorithm complete with all possibles methods: 
## 1. Print the vector 
## 2. Insert elements in the vector
## 3. Linear search and binary search
## 4. Remove elementos from the vector

### All steps to implement the code is explained in Stack.py file.
